# ANN-classification-churn
This project involves building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict customer churn â€” whether a customer is likely to leave a company's services. The dataset used is a typical Churn Modeling Dataset, which contains customer demographics, account information, and behavioral data from a telecom or banking domain.
The goal is to classify customers as either "Exited" (1) or "Retained" (0) based on input features such as:
Geography
Gender
Age
Tenure
Balance
Number of products used
Credit score
Whether the customer has a credit card or is an active member
Estimated salary
